# Biograph Cybersecurity Planning Discussion

## üåü Vision

Enable Biograph to accelerate scientific and business innovation securely‚Äîby strengthening what works, advancing key capabilities, and protecting sensitive data with resilience and trust. This strategy builds incrementally on existing foundations, guided by real-world risks and practical execution.

## üîÅ From Conversation to Continuous Execution
This strategy framework is designed to provided a basis for prioritizing the contiunous execution of security priorities. By the end of this discussion, we will have identified:
* Potention opportunities and challenges across your security domains
* Practices that align to your culture, capabilities, and customer expectations
* Tangible actions‚Äîbig or small‚Äîthat can strengthen your current program 

Vetting and refining what is discussed here with stakeholders across the organization, security planning and execution will be:
* Domain-driven ‚Äì Focused on highest priority security domains where progress will have the highest impact
* Lens-aligned ‚Äì Structured by the cross-functional realities of your organization (e.g., culture, measurement, execution)
* Actionable ‚Äì Grounded in realistic next steps that reflect your current maturity and operating environment
* Measurable ‚Äì Supported by simple metrics or milestones that show progress without creating noise

## üî¢ Strategic Framing: How We Approach the Security Discussion

Biograph‚Äôs cybersecurity strategy is structured around two complementary layers: **cross-functional lenses** and **core security domains**.

### üéØ Lenses: What Drives Focus

These are the strategic dimensions we use to frame challenges and opportunities across all areas of security:

- **Risk Alignment** ‚Äì Are we protecting what matters most, in ways that reflect Biograph‚Äôs customers and threats?
- **Culture** ‚Äì How do behaviors, expectations, and norms influence security decisions and adoption?
- **Measurement** ‚Äì How do we track progress, spot gaps, and make improvements visible?
- **Execution** ‚Äì How effectively are we implementing security in practice?

These lenses help us **prioritize and focus**, ensuring that security efforts are not just technical but also aligned with real-world context‚Äîincluding the needs of:

- **High-net-worth individuals** who demand privacy, control, and trust
- **Research partners** who need reliable, auditable, collaborative access

### üõ†Ô∏è Domains: Where the Work Happens

The lenses are applied across seven core **security domains**, where specific improvements and initiatives take place:

- Identity & Access Management  
- Data Protection  
- Threat Detection & Response  
- Endpoint & Device Security  
- Application Security  
- Infrastructure & Network Security  
- Resilience & Continuity  

Each domain represents a distinct area of operational focus. Applying the lenses we'll uncover: What‚Äôs working? What‚Äôs risky? What‚Äôs cultural? What‚Äôs measurable? What‚Äôs executable?

### üîç Focus Questions

To start, some questions to consider against the above domains:

- Where do you see the biggest opportunity for impact if we made security improvements?
- Which domain gets the most discussion or attention internally right now?
- If we made meaningful progress in one area, where would it ripple through most effectively?

### Identity & Access Management
<details>

<summary> Questions</summary>

| Risk Alignment | Culture | Measurement | Execution |
|----------------|---------|-------------|-----------|
| Do our access controls reflect the expectations of high-net-worth clients for privacy and control, as well as the data-sharing needs of research partners? | How are identities managed in practice across teams and systems‚Äîand how much variation is there in how people access what they need? | Do we regularly audit access and track privilege creep? | How consistent and centralized is access control across your systems today‚Äîand how much of it depends on manual effort or tribal knowledge? |
| How mature is the process for requesting, approving, and tracking 3rd party access? | What is our risk appetite for malicious employee activity? | Is there a central location tracking all roles and access? | What is our confidence that former employees do not have access to any system? |
