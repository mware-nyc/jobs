# Biograph Cybersecurity Planning Discussion

## üåü Vision

Enable Biograph to accelerate scientific and business innovation securely‚Äîby strengthening what works, advancing key capabilities, and protecting sensitive data with resilience and trust. This strategy builds incrementally on existing foundations, guided by real-world risks and practical execution.

## üîÅ From Conversation to Continuous Execution
This strategy framework is designed not just to diagnose gaps‚Äîbut to spark momentum. By the end of this discussion, we will have identified:
* Specific risks and challenges across your security domains
* Practices that align to your culture, capabilities, and customer expectations
* Tangible actions‚Äîbig or small‚Äîthat can help move your program forward

We‚Äôll take what we‚Äôve uncovered together and shape it into a one-year security improvement plan that is:
* Domain-driven ‚Äì Focused on 2‚Äì3 security domains where progress will have the highest impact
* Lens-aligned ‚Äì Structured by the cross-functional realities of your organization (e.g., culture, measurement, execution)
* Actionable ‚Äì Grounded in realistic next steps that reflect your current maturity and operating environment
* Measurable ‚Äì Supported by simple metrics or milestones that show progress without creating noise

## üî¢ Strategic Framing: How We Approach the Security Discussion

Biograph‚Äôs cybersecurity strategy is structured around two complementary layers: **cross-functional lenses** and **core security domains**.

### üéØ Lenses: What Drives Focus

These are the strategic dimensions we use to frame challenges and opportunities across all areas of security:

- **Risk Alignment** ‚Äì Are we protecting what matters most, in ways that reflect Biograph‚Äôs customers and threats?
- **Culture** ‚Äì How do behaviors, expectations, and norms influence security decisions and adoption?
- **Measurement** ‚Äì How do we track progress, spot gaps, and make improvements visible?
- **Execution** ‚Äì How effectively are we implementing security in practice?

These lenses help us **prioritize and focus**, ensuring that security efforts are not just technical but also aligned with real-world context‚Äîincluding the needs of:

- **High-net-worth individuals** who demand privacy, control, and trust
- **Research partners** who need reliable, auditable, collaborative access

### üõ†Ô∏è Domains: Where the Work Happens

The lenses are applied across seven core **security domains**, where specific improvements and initiatives take place:

- Identity & Access Management  
- Data Protection  
- Threat Detection & Response  
- Endpoint & Device Security  
- Application Security  
- Infrastructure & Network Security  
- Resilience & Continuity  

Each domain represents a distinct area of operational focus. As we review each, we use the lenses to guide discussion: What‚Äôs working? What‚Äôs risky? What‚Äôs cultural? What‚Äôs measurable? What‚Äôs executable?

### üîç Focus Questions

To help stakeholders engage meaningfully, we also ask:

- Where do you see the biggest opportunity for impact if we made security improvements?
- Which domain gets the most discussion or attention internally right now?
- If we made meaningful progress in one area, where would it ripple through most effectively?

### Identity & Access Management
